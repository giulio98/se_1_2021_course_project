# Estimation approach
The estimation by product decomposition allows us to estimate the size of the project and its cost, instead the estimation by activity decomposition allow us to know the effort to make in each activity of the project. This Estimation is based on our EZShop requirement.

### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | :-------------------------------: |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |            28                 |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |            55                | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) |           1540              |             
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |   160    |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 480 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 1 (5 days)|
