# Progetto Software Engineering
The purpose of this project was the development of a project in java code through the waterfall methodology with a strong focus on testing (unit testing, e2e) and the
experimentation of white / black box testing in combination with tools such as J-Unit to verify the coverage of the code. The relative documentation is available in ezshop/delivarables.
